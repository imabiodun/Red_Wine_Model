## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Red Wine Quality dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various chemical properties of red wines and their corresponding quality ratings.

## Features

The dataset includes the following features:

- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol

## Target

The quality-level feature is used as the target variable which was derived from the quality feature in the original dataset


## Evaluation:
   Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, Confusion Matrix.
